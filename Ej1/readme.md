1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vyeli/72.75-Aprendizaje_Automatico-Machine_Learning
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**: Change your working directory to the project folder.

   ```bash
   cd Ej1
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use pipenv to install the project's dependencies from the Pipfile.

   ```bash
   pipenv install
   ```

### Running the Exercise

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the exercise using the following steps:

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Activate the project's virtual environment using pipenv.

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

2. **Run the Exercise**: Execute the exercise script or Jupyter Notebook as needed.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Ej1.ipynb
   ```

3. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**: After you're done with the exercise, you can deactivate the virtual environment.

   ```bash
   exit
   ```
